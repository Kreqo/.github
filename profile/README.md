## Kreqo

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# Plan of action

When this README plan of action is mature and restructured, remove comments.

## Phase One
1. List all projects for the Kreqo organization
2. Make a draft for the structure of everything (common code, database, server, apps, cross-platform, JIT compilation, website, branding, rfcs, book?)
3. Order projects by priority
4. Make a draft of GUI App ideals (goals) and guidelines (find the one I have in my head from Xilem/Druid/Iced/Leptos?)
5. Make a draft of UI/UX best practices
6. Make a draft of Cross-platform App architecture and list platforms
7. Make a draft of Performance architecture and guidelines (JIT compilation & full app_restart-time compilation, parallelization, SIMD, GPU optimisation)
8. Make a draft of Security guidelines
9. Decide which licenses to use across Kreqo (probably same as Xilem or Iced)
10. Think about how the common code repo shares types, traits, functions, macros, etc. and think about a rough idea for what will be shared or not
11. Review drafts & decisions so far against research

## Phase Two
1. Start working on essential repos + the top priority project simultaneously
2. Note any frictions, ideas, and research in here along the way
3. At the point where the first project is functional and at least one refactoring happened, review everything + notes taken and make new direction decisions



README TODOs:
- Introduction: Who? What? Who? When? Where? Why? How? in brief
- Org's vision, mission, core values (promote use of Linux, cross-platform, open-source, intuitivity, quality, flexibility but with opinionated defaults)
- Structure of organization
- List of projects and their READMEs
- Plan of action (research, development phases, steps, drafts)
- Contribution guidelines (issues/discussions -> RFCs, forks & PRs, semver)

Questions for myself:
- How will the documentation for all Kreqo projects be structured? I thought about 1 mdBook/project, everything on kreqo-website (interactive docs), docs inside the app/game/software (a.k.a. self documented).
- How to organize common, misc, apps, and libs inside Kreqo? Maybe group relevant stuff inside workspaces?

Awesome Rust/Cargo:
- Types: thiserror, anyhow, anymore
- Development: tracing
- Frameworks: axum, leptos, dioxus, iced, bevy, xilem
- Libraries: syn, vello, rs-fsrs, server_fn, winit, blitz, sqlx, tokio
- Performance: wgpu, fearless_simd, rayon
- Security: bcrypt, argon2
- Ser/De: serde, bitcode
